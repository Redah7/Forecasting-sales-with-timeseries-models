# Forecasting-sales-with-timeseries-models
 I'd like to create a model that can predict bike sales using timeseries data. I will be using an ensemble of machine learning models. The ensemble approach combines the strengths of individual models to improve forecasting performance and capture complex patterns in bike sales data.
